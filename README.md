# Coachatron
Coachatron is a little game made for the "Make Something Horrible" game jam (from the french magazine CanardPC). The aim of this jam was to make the most awful game.
For this jam, we have to choose 2 themes from an official french document about publishing games. The fun thing about this document is that you can make weird matches with those types (ex: Eductional FPS).
So, Coachatron is a kind of Sport-RPG, you are a coach, and have to choose sentences in order to motivate your team. I let you guess that whatever choice you make, the result is the same, it has to be an horrible game !

The game needs a lot of code refactoring, because it has been done in a hurry...
